# Uni Calendar Coloring

Turn your university timetable into a color-coded Google Calendar.

The university calendar is read-only and every event in it has the same color.
`unical` copies it into a Google Calendar you own and colors each event:

- **Exams**: red if you are enrolled, grey if you are not. Once you enroll in
  one session of an exam, its other sessions turn grey.
- **Lectures**: one color per course, with the boilerplate stripped from the
  title.
- **Deadlines**: one color per deadline.

![The terminal UI, Exams tab](docs/tui.svg)

What counts as an exam, a lecture or a deadline is decided by the
[rules of your profile](#profile-and-rules), so the tool adapts to the format of
any university. The built-in profile handles the Politecnico di Milano format
(`Esame: …`, `Lezione: Didattica - …`, `Scadenza: …`).

Your choices are saved in a plain JSON file, `profile.json`, so every later sync
uses the same colors. You can run `unical` from a terminal UI, from plain
command-line flags, or on a weekly schedule with GitHub Actions.

## Quick start

Run without manual virtual environments using `uvx`:

```bash
uvx uni-calendar-coloring
# or directly from GitHub:
uvx --from git+https://github.com/Bert0ns/uni-calendar-coloring.git unical
```

Or run standalone pre-built binaries (no Python required):

```bash
# Download binary from GitHub Releases for your OS, make executable, and run:
./unical
```

The terminal UI opens and guides you through the first run and credentials setup. Nothing is written
to Google Calendar until you apply the changes.

## How it works

```
Source calendar ──read──▶ discover ──▶ preferences ──▶ plan ──▶ apply ──write──▶ your colored calendar
(Google or iCal)          courses,      saved colors,    diff of    batched
                          exams,        rules, or        inserts/   Google API
                          deadlines     your edits       updates/   calls
                                                         deletes
```

1. **Discover**: read the source events and list the courses, exam sessions and
   deadlines they contain.
2. **Preferences**: load your saved colors and subscriptions. Anything you
   haven't chosen yet is filled in by the [coloring rules](#coloring-rules), or
   you choose it yourself in the TUI or with the `-i` prompts.
3. **Plan**: compare the source with the target calendar and work out the
   events to insert, update and delete. Unchanged events cost no API calls.
4. **Apply**: send the changes through the Google batch API, retrying transient
   failures.

The sync is safe to repeat:

- Only events the tool created are updated or deleted. They're tagged with a
  private property. Events you add to the target calendar yourself are left
  alone.
- Events removed from the source are removed from the target.
- An event that the current run doesn't cover (for example, a lecture during
  `unical exams`) is ignored: its copy in the target calendar is never
  inserted, updated or deleted. Events removed from the source are only deleted
  by a run that covers everything.
- The target calendar is created on the first sync.

## Setup

You need a Google account (and **Python 3.12+** if installing via `uv`, `pipx`, or source; standalone pre-built binaries require no Python runtime). The tool runs under your own Google Cloud OAuth client, so nobody else ever sees your calendar.

### 1. Create Google API credentials

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and
   create a **new project**.
2. Go to **APIs & Services → Library** and enable the **Google Calendar API**.
3. Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:
   - Choose the **External** user type and fill in the required fields.
   - Under **Test users**, add your own Google address. If you skip this, login
     fails with `403 access_denied`.
4. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client
   ID**, choose **Desktop app**, then download the JSON file.
5. Import it directly into your user configuration directory:
   ```bash
   unical auth import /path/to/downloaded-credentials.json
   ```
   (Alternatively, save it as `credentials.json` in your working directory, or simply launch `unical` and let the interactive setup wizard prompt you for the file).

### 2. Install

Choose the installation method that best suits your environment:

#### Standalone Executable (Recommended - No Python Required)

Pre-built single-file executables are automatically generated and attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Bert0ns/uni-calendar-coloring/releases):

- **Linux (x86_64)**: `unical-linux-x86_64` (or `unical-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`)
- **macOS (Universal - Apple Silicon & Intel)**: `unical-macos-universal` (or `unical-macos-universal.tar.gz`)
- **Windows (x86_64)**: `unical-windows-x86_64.exe` (or `unical-windows-x86_64.zip`)

On Linux / macOS:
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Bert0ns/uni-calendar-coloring/releases/latest/download/unical-linux-x86_64
chmod +x unical-linux-x86_64
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv unical-linux-x86_64 ~/.local/bin/unical
```

On Windows:
Download `unical-windows-x86_64.exe` (or unzip `unical-windows-x86_64.zip`), rename to `unical.exe`, and run it from PowerShell or Command Prompt.

#### Modern CLI Tool Managers (uv / pipx)

Installs `unical` in an isolated environment and makes the command available system-wide:

**Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (fastest):**
```bash
# Install from PyPI:
uv tool install uni-calendar-coloring

# Or install directly from the Git repository:
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Bert0ns/uni-calendar-coloring.git

# Or run ephemerally with uvx:
uvx uni-calendar-coloring
```

**Using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):**
```bash
# Install from PyPI:
pipx install uni-calendar-coloring

# Or install directly from the Git repository:
pipx install git+https://github.com/Bert0ns/uni-calendar-coloring.git
```

#### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install Bert0ns/tap/unical
```

#### From Source (Git clone / Virtualenv)

For contributors and developers:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bert0ns/uni-calendar-coloring.git
cd uni-calendar-coloring
pip install .
```

This installs the `unical` command. `python -m unical` works too.

### 3. First run

```bash
unical
```

Your browser opens so you can log in with Google, and the login is saved to
`token.json`. Without a browser (WSL, SSH), the login URL is printed for you to
open by hand.

When there is no `profile.json` yet, the [terminal UI](#terminal-ui) opens a
short guide:

1. **The calendar with your timetable**: pick it from your Google calendars.
2. **The calendar to write to**: pick one, or keep the suggested new name. A new
   calendar is only created when you apply the changes.
3. **Recognizing your events**: see how the built-in Politecnico di Milano rules
   classify your events, then keep them, adjust them, or start from scratch in
   the Rules tab.

The guide ends on a preview of the changes. Nothing is written to Google
Calendar until you apply them. Your choices are saved in `profile.json`, and the
guide only runs while that file doesn't exist. Press `Escape` on the welcome
screen to skip it.

Without the terminal UI, create `profile.json` yourself with the two calendars
(the rules and colors start from the built-in profile), then try a dry run:

```json
{
  "calendars": {
    "source": "My University",
    "target": "Colored Calendar"
  }
}
```

```bash
unical --dry-run
```

If you'd rather not subscribe to the source calendar in Google, give the tool
your [iCal URL](#use-an-ical-url-as-the-source) instead. All settings are listed
under [Configuration](#configuration).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The colored calendar is a **copy** of the original calendar. In Google
> Calendar, hide the original calendar (untick it in the sidebar) to avoid
> seeing every event twice. If you use an iCal URL as the source, there is
> nothing to hide.

## Usage

### Authentication

Manage credentials and check login status with `unical auth`:

```bash
unical auth import /path/to/downloaded-credentials.json   # copy credentials to user config directory
unical auth import /path/to/credentials.json -m           # move instead of copy
unical auth status                                        # inspect credentials, token cache, and profile status
unical auth login                                         # authenticate with Google and cache token in advance
unical doctor                                             # diagnose the whole setup, including the connection to Google
```

Before opening the browser, `unical auth login` reminds you that a
`403 access_denied` page from Google means your address is missing under
**Test users** on the
[OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).
Google shows that error in the browser, so the tool can't detect it: if the
login doesn't finish within 5 minutes, it gives up with the same hint. If you
click **Cancel** on Google's page, the login stops with an explanation instead of
retrying.

> If your university Google Workspace account can't create Google Cloud projects
> or OAuth clients, create them with a personal `@gmail.com` account instead.

`unical doctor` checks everything a sync needs, without logging in through the
browser, and reports each check as pass, warn, fail or skip:

- the config directory and the profile, credentials and token paths;
- the format of `credentials.json`: a Desktop app client passes; a Web
  application client gets a warning (its login fails with
  `redirect_uri_mismatch`); a service account key or a malformed file fails;
- the saved login: whether it exists and has the Calendar scope, when it
  expires, and whether it can still be refreshed;
- access to the Google Calendar API;
- that the source calendar exists and that the target calendar is writable.

It exits with code 1 if any check fails, so you can use it in scripts and CI.

### Version and updates

Check running version and inspect PyPI for newer releases:

```bash
unical --version                                          # print current version
unical version                                            # check if an update is available on PyPI
unical version --no-check                                 # print version without checking network
```

When a newer version is published, `unical` displays a non-intrusive upgrade notice at the end of CLI operations and as a notification in the terminal UI. Update checks are cached for 24 hours to prevent network delays and can be suppressed with `--no-update-check` or `UNICAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

### Sync

```bash
unical                       # open the terminal UI (the default)
unical --no-tui              # plain sync: exams, lectures and deadlines
unical exams --no-tui        # only (re)color exams
unical lectures --no-tui
unical deadlines --no-tui
```

Run from a terminal, `unical` opens the [terminal UI](#terminal-ui). It falls
back to a plain sync when there is no terminal (cron, CI, a pipe) or when you pass
`-i`, `-n`/`--dry-run` or `--no-tui`. The plain sync is non-interactive: anything new gets a color from the
[coloring rules](#coloring-rules), and that color is saved for future runs.

Useful flags:

```bash
unical --dry-run                   # plain sync, show the changes, write nothing
unical -v                          # explain the decision for every event
unical -q                          # only warnings and errors
unical --prune-before 2026-02-01   # also delete synced events before this date
```

`--prune-before` is handy for dropping past semesters. Flags can be combined,
e.g. `unical lectures --dry-run -v`. The command exits with a non-zero status if
any calendar operation fails.

### Terminal UI

```bash
unical
unical exams          # only the Exams and Sync tabs
```

`--tui` forces it even when the shell doesn't look interactive. It opens on the
**Setup** tab, with one
more tab per kind of event:

| Tab           | What you can do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup**     | The calendar to read from, the one to write to, and the time zone of a new target calendar. Pick the calendars from your Google calendars, or type a new name for the target. Choices are saved right away. Also has the selector for what a sync covers. |
| **Courses**   | Every course in the source with its color. Pick a new color from the 11 Google colors.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Exams**     | Every exam session with its date, what the source calendar says (_enrolled_ / _not enrolled_), whether you're already subscribed to another date, and your subscription. Toggle the subscription or pick a color.                                       |
| **Deadlines** | Same as Courses, for deadlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Sync**      | Choose what to color: everything, lectures only, exams only or deadlines only (the other tabs follow). **Preview changes** lists the inserts, updates and deletes. **Apply** writes them to Google Calendar with a live progress panel.               |
| **Rules**     | The [rules](#profile-and-rules) that decide what each event is, and the exam enrollment conditions. A live preview shows how every event title is classified.                                                                                         |

In the Sync tab, expand an event in the preview to see its color, time and
original title. While applying, the progress panel shows a spinner, a bar, how
many inserts, updates and deletes are written, and the time elapsed and left.

In the Rules tab, add, edit, delete and reorder rules, or press Enter on an
unmatched event to start a rule from its title.

The **Status** column shows where each value comes from:

- **saved**: chosen earlier and stored in the profile.
- **suggested**: not chosen yet, so the coloring rules decide. It's saved at the
  next sync.
- **modified**: changed in this session and not saved yet.
- **not set**: an exam with no enrollment information. Its color is left as is
  until you choose one.

| Key           | Action                                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter` / `c` | Pick a color for the selected row              |
| `Space`       | Toggle the exam subscription (Exams tab)       |
| `Ctrl+S`      | Save rules and preferences without syncing     |
| `p`           | Preview the changes                            |
| `a`           | Apply the previewed changes                    |
| `n`           | New rule (Rules tab)                           |
| `e` / `Enter` | Edit the selected rule (Rules tab)             |
| `d`           | Delete the selected rule (Rules tab)           |
| `[` / `]`     | Move the selected rule up / down (Rules tab)   |
| `q`           | Quit (asks again if there are unsaved changes) |

Toggling a subscription switches between the default red and grey. A custom
color you picked for the exam is kept. Applying saves your preferences, just
like a normal sync. If you edit something after a preview, preview again before
applying.

With an iCal URL the source can't be changed in the Setup tab. If
`SOURCE_CALENDAR_NAME` or `TARGET_CALENDAR_NAME` is set, it replaces the saved
calendar every time the tool starts, and the tab says so.

### Interactive prompts

```bash
unical -i
unical exams -i
```

Without the TUI you get a question-by-question flow before the sync: your
subscription to each exam session, then a color for each course and deadline.
The current choice is the default, so you can press Enter to keep it. Other
dates of the same exam with no saved choice reuse your first answer. Add
`--dry-run` to try choices without saving them.

### Use an iCal URL as the source

You can read events straight from your personal iCal feed (e.g. from your
university app) instead of a Google calendar:

```bash
unical --ical "https://ical.example.com/<id>/<token>"
```

Or set it once in `.env`, where it takes precedence over the source calendar:

```bash
SOURCE_ICAL_URL="https://ical.example.com/<id>/<token>"
```

Recurring events (`RRULE`/`EXDATE`) are passed to Google, which expands them.
Rules can match the feed's `CATEGORIES` with `"field": "category"`. The built-in
PoliMi rules use them (`Lezione`, `Esame`, `Scadenza`) when the title prefixes
are missing.

> [!WARNING]
> Treat the iCal URL like a password: anyone who has it can read your timetable.
> Keep it in `.env` (which is gitignored) or in a CI secret, never in
> `profile.json`. The tool never logs it; `-v` shows only the host with the
> token redacted.

## Profile and rules

`profile.json` holds everything about your calendar: the calendars to sync, the
rules that classify events, and the colors and subscriptions you chose. Without
one, the tool starts from the built-in PoliMi profile and saves it on the first
sync, so you can see and edit the rules.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "Politecnico di Milano",
  "calendars": {
    "source": "Calendar",
    "target": "Calendar Colored",
    "time_zone": null
  },
  "rules": [

The example is shortened. The built-in profile has six rules: the title prefix
and the iCal category of each kind of event.

When the target calendar doesn't exist, the first sync creates it in
`time_zone`, an [IANA time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
such as `Europe/Rome`. With `null`, it gets the time zone of your primary Google
calendar.

### Rules

Rules are checked in order and the first one that matches decides the kind of
the event. Events that match no rule are copied without a color. Without a
`rules` key, the built-in PoliMi rules apply; `"rules": []` means no rules. The
easiest way to write them is the **Rules** tab of the
[terminal UI](#terminal-ui), which shows live how each event is classified.

| Key           | Values                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kind`        | `exam`, `lecture` or `deadline`.                                                           |
| `field`       | What to look at: `title`, `description`, `location` or `category` (any iCal category).     |
| `match`       | `starts_with`, `contains`, `equals` or `regex` (a Python regular expression, searched).    |
| `value`       | The text or regular expression to match.                                                   |
| `ignore_case` | `true` to ignore upper/lower case. Optional, `false` by default.                           |
| `title`       | Title in the colored calendar. `{title}` is the original title, `{name}` the event's name. |

The **name** of an event identifies its course, exam or deadline: lectures with
the same name share a color. It's the title without the matched text when the
rule looks at the title (`Lezione: Didattica - Algebra` → `Algebra`), and the
whole title otherwise. With a `regex`, a `(?P<name>…)` group picks it out
explicitly, e.g. `^\[\w+\] (?P<name>.+) - Lecture$` turns
`[CS101] Algorithms - Lecture` into `Algorithms`.

`enrollment` is optional: it tells, from an exam event, whether you're enrolled
(`enrolled`) or not (`not_enrolled`). Each is a condition like the ones of the
rules, or `null`. Invalid rules are skipped with a warning.

## Coloring rules

These rules fill in anything you haven't chosen yourself. Your saved choices
always win.

| Event                                                 | Rule                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Exam, another session of an exam you're subscribed to | Not subscribed, **Graphite** (grey). Checked first.                      |
| Exam, the `enrolled` condition matches                | Subscribed, **Tomato** (red).                                            |
| Exam, the `not_enrolled` condition matches            | Not subscribed, **Graphite**.                                            |
| Exam, no information                                  | Left uncolored until you choose.                                         |
| Lecture                                               | A color derived from the course name, so it's the same on every machine. |
| Deadline                                              | A color derived from the name.                                           |

### Saved preferences

| Profile key | Content                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `courses`   | `{"<course>": "<color id>"}`                                            |
| `exams`     | `{"<exam name> (<YYYY-MM-DD>)": {"color": "<id>", "subscribed": true}}` |
| `deadlines` | `{"<deadline>": "<color id>"}`                                          |

Color IDs are Google's: 1 Lavender, 2 Sage, 3 Grape, 4 Flamingo, 5 Banana, 6
Tangerine, 7 Peacock, 8 Graphite, 9 Blueberry, 10 Basil, 11 Tomato. You can edit
the file by hand. Invalid entries are skipped with a warning, and the file is
written atomically, so an interrupted run can't corrupt it.

## Configuration

The calendars, rules and colors live in the [profile](#profile-and-rules). The
optional settings below come from environment variables, usually set in `.env`
(see `.env.example`).

Configuration and credential paths (`PROFILE_PATH`, `CREDENTIALS_PATH`, `TOKEN_PATH`)
are resolved in this order:
1. Explicit environment variable (relative paths resolved from current working directory).
2. Current working directory (`./credentials.json`, `./profile.json`, etc.) if the file exists.
3. Standard user configuration directory for your platform:
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/unical/` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/unical/`)
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/unical/`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\unical\`

| Variable               | Default                          | Description                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `PROFILE_PATH`         | `profile.json` or config dir     | The profile.                                    |
| `SOURCE_CALENDAR_NAME` | _(the profile's)_                | Overrides the calendar to read from.            |
| `TARGET_CALENDAR_NAME` | _(the profile's)_                | Overrides the calendar to write to.             |
| `SOURCE_ICAL_URL`      | _(unset)_                        | Read from this iCal feed instead of a calendar. |
| `CREDENTIALS_PATH`     | `credentials.json` or config dir | OAuth client downloaded from Google Cloud.      |
| `TOKEN_PATH`           | `token.json` or config dir       | Cached Google login.                            |
| `UNICAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`| `0`                              | Set to `1` or `true` to disable version checks. |
| `UNICAL_CACHE_DIR`     | platform cache dir               | Custom directory for version check cache.       |

## Run it in the cloud with GitHub Actions

The repository includes a workflow,
[`.github/workflows/manual_sync.yml`](.github/workflows/manual_sync.yml), that
syncs **every Monday at 06:00 UTC**. You can also run it from the **Actions**
tab and choose what to sync, verbose output, or a dry run.

1. Fork the repository and commit your own `profile.json` (the one in the
   repository belongs to its author), or override the calendar names with the
   secrets below.
2. Log in locally once so that `token.json` exists, e.g. with
   `unical --dry-run`.
3. In your fork, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add
   these repository secrets:

   | Secret                 | Value                                                       |
   | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | Contents of `credentials.json`.                             |
   | `GCP_TOKEN_JSON`       | Contents of `token.json`.                                   |
   | `SOURCE_CALENDAR_NAME` | Optional, overrides the profile's source calendar.          |
   | `TARGET_CALENDAR_NAME` | Optional, overrides the profile's target calendar.          |
   | `SOURCE_ICAL_URL`      | Optional. If set, it's used instead of the source calendar. |

After each run, the workflow commits the updated `profile.json` back to the
repository, so colors you pick locally (and push) and colors the cloud run
assigns stay in sync.

> [!NOTE]
> While your OAuth app is in **Testing** mode, Google expires the login after 7
> days. The cloud run can't open a browser, so it then fails with a "login
> required" message. Run the tool locally to log in again and update the
> `GCP_TOKEN_JSON` secret.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                                   | Fix                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Not sure what's wrong                                     | Run `unical doctor`: it checks credentials, login, API access and calendars, and says how to fix each issue. |
| `403 access_denied` when logging in                       | Add your Google address as a **Test user** on the OAuth consent screen.                                      |
| `Google login was cancelled or denied (access_denied)`    | You clicked Cancel, or your address isn't a **Test user**. Fix that, then run `unical auth login`.           |
| `Timed out after 5 minutes waiting for the Google login`  | Google probably showed an error page. Check the Test users list, then run `unical auth login` again.         |
| `Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch` in the browser         | The OAuth client is a Web application. Create a **Desktop app** client and run `unical auth import` again.   |
| Can't create a project or OAuth client                    | Your university Workspace account may block it: use a personal `@gmail.com` account for Google Cloud.        |
| `OAuth client file 'credentials.json' not found`          | Download the Desktop OAuth client JSON and save it as `credentials.json`, or point `CREDENTIALS_PATH` to it. |
| `Source calendar '…' not found`                           | The source calendar in `profile.json` must match the name exactly as shown in Google Calendar.               |
| Every event shows up twice                                | Hide the original calendar in Google Calendar.                                                               |
| `Could not download iCal feed`                            | The iCal URL may have expired or been revoked. Generate a new one.                                           |
| `The terminal UI needs the 'textual' dependency`          | Run `pip install .`.                                                                                         |
| Login keeps expiring after a week                         | That's Google's Testing mode: log in again locally (and update `GCP_TOKEN_JSON` if you use GitHub Actions).  |
| Some events have no color                                 | They match no rule. Check the Rules tab, where unmatched titles are listed.                                  |

## Upgrading

- **The command was renamed** from `calendar-coloring` to `unical`, and the
  Python package from `calendar_coloring` to `unical`. Reinstall with
  `pip install .`, and update scripts and cron jobs. `profile.json`,
  `token.json` and the events already in your target calendar keep working.
- `token.pickle` is migrated to `token.json` automatically, and the old
  `GCP_TOKEN_PICKLE_B64` secret is still accepted.
- Events synced by older versions carry an older tag: the next sync updates each
  of them once to the current tag, then they're left alone again.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest          # unit, golden regression, Textual pilot and packaging tests
mypy            # strict type checking
ruff check .    # linting
black .         # formatting
pre-commit install

# Build standalone single-file binary with PyInstaller:
pyinstaller packaging/unical.spec
./dist/unical --help

# Build distribution wheels & sdist:
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

CI runs all of the above on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 and requires 95% test
coverage.

## Architecture

The core never prints, prompts or touches the network directly. It depends on
small interfaces (ports) that the adapters implement, so the CLI, the
interactive prompts and the TUI are all thin frontends over the same discover →
preferences → plan → apply phases.
